title: SRVRE
---

Simple RISC-V research environment.

This is an operating system for the purposes of learning OS development
and attempting to solve some of the shortcomings of existing operating systems.
The ultimate goal is to make it compile itself, maybe even to make it usable
for limited command-line or server usage.

So far only the kernel exists. See its [project page](/md/srvre/kernel.md)
and [wiki](/md/srvre/kernel/wiki.md) for further information about it.
