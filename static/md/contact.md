title: Contact Info
---

You can use any of the following methods to contact me.
The communication channels are sorted by personal preference, security
and availability.

Please submit bug reports or feature requests to my Codeberg repositories.
If the project is still hosted on GitHub please use that
if you already have an account.
In short, submit issues or PRs to the project's external mirror.

You may also contact me directly if you prefer not to use those code forges.
Please don't do this if you already have accounts for them in order to help
keep project metadata well-organized in one place. Mailing lists are planned in
the near future.

Cryptography
============

PGP
---

I prefer PGP over S/MIME due to its decentralised nature. I use the following keys:

* [22B9 F7CC 2C1A 94BF DCFE 7EAB 9E66 CD77 9885 511F](/pgp/22B9F7CC2C1A94BFDCFE7EAB9E66CD779885511F.gpg.asc) for email (including well-known aliases)

* [4213 380C C49E CFB2 EF77 264F DB66 ACE0 BF1E 7D16](/pgp/4213380CC49ECFB2EF77264FDB66ACE0BF1E7D16.gpg.asc) for backup email

OMEMO
-----

I use OMEMO for XMPP due to the deniability.
