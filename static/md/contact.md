You can use any of the following methods to contact me.
The communication channels are sorted by personal preference, security
and availability.

Please submit bug reports or feature requests to my Codeberg repositories.
If the project is still hosted on GitHub please use that
if you already have an account.
In short, submit issues or PRs to the project's external mirror.

You may also contact me directly if you prefer not to use those code forges.
Please don't do this if you already have accounts for them
in order to help keep project metadata well-organized in one place.

Cryptography
============

PGP
---

I prefer PGP over S/MIME due to its decentralised nature. I use the following keys:

* [2152 D04D BFFE 3567 CD15 F58B A3D3 E205 DA0B 0401](/pgp/2152D04DBFFE3567CD15F58BA3D3E205DA0B0401.gpg.asc) for git commit signing
* [4213 380C C49E CFB2 EF77 264F DB66 ACE0 BF1E 7D16](/pgp/4213380CC49ECFB2EF77264FDB66ACE0BF1E7D16.gpg.asc) for email
* [F740 BD95 1299 D26B 8B4F F28B 2E6C 9B91 802E DCC4](/pgp/F740BD951299D26B8B4FF28B2E6C9B91802EDCC4.gpg.asc) for legacy email (gmail)

OMEMO
-----

I use OMEMO for XMPP due to it not using signatures verifiable by everyone unlike PGP.

Fingerprints:

* `5d925ee5 7c8b4c1f 43b0f55e 4bdfe56b 33b9dbaf 66272b3c 83340919 0956d422`

S/MIME
------

This is a TLS-like alternative to PGP email encryption that's easier to use.
I used to have a certificate, though the CA doesn't accept CSRs.
It is for this reason that I've decided to stop supporting S/MIME.
Please use PGP instead.
