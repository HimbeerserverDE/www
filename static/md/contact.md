Cryptography
============

PGP
---

I prefer PGP over S/MIME due to its decentralised nature. I use the following keys:

* [2152 D04D BFFE 3567 CD15 F58B A3D3 E205 DA0B 0401](/pgp/2152D04DBFFE3567CD15F58BA3D3E205DA0B0401.asc) for git commit signing
* [F740 BD95 1299 D26B 8B4F F28B 2E6C 9B91 802E DCC4](/pgp/F740BD951299D26B8B4FF28B2E6C9B91802EDCC4.asc) for email.

S/MIME
------

This is a TLS-like alternative to PGP email encryption that's easier to use.
I used to have a certificate, though the CA doesn't accept CSRs.
It is for this reason that I've decided to stop supporting S/MIME.
Please use PGP instead.
